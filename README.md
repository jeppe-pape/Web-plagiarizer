# Web-plagiarizer
 
This script is partly a joke response to the recent accusations against the Danish proffessor Marianne Stidsens plagiarization of online encyclopedic entries as well as newspaper articles. It is supposed to brute-force-style do an exact match (quoted search in DuckDuckGo) of each sentence in a given .txt file and output a .json containing all the matches found.

It actually manages to find all known cases of plagiarization in StidsenÂ´s text "Den Nordiske MeToo-Revolution 2018" as well as a couple of new spots.
It would be wonderful to actually run Stidsens (very large) doctoral dissertation through this script to see if similar cases would be found. I, however, sadly have not been able to find an online version to parse into .txt..  

It is a very rudimentary script that can be greatly improved - but it is fundamentally very slow and as such maybe it should be left as is :))
